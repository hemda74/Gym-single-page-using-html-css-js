                            You’ll find thousands of different workout options here, for people of all different levels of fitness experience: beginner, moderate, intermediate, and advanced. (Classes are sorted by fitness level, as well by length and style, so you’ll be sure to easily find what you need.)
                            There are lots of types of yoga classes—from Ashtanga to Vinyasa—fitness classes like HIIT or barre—and even skills-based classes, wherein you’ll learn to perfect your handstand or boost your flexibility to hit a split. Plus, you can take your workout with you (say, maybe your backyard or an open park), 
                            since you can download the routines for on-the-go use.
                            Cost: $20/month.

                            The P.Volve fitness method uses resistance-based, high-intensity (but low-impact!) moves to help build functional strength.
                            With P.Volve’s                              If you’re ready to add more resistance, Obe also sells options equipment, you’ll have access to more than 200 workouts (with new ones added weekly), that you can search based on things like body parts worked or length of time.
                            The plan is customizable, and based off your goals, 
                            the app will actually suggest workouts for you each week, which takes some guesswork out of your program. P.Volve also sells optional equipment, like the flexible P.ball, resistance bands, and ankle weights.

                            With Obe Fitness, you’ll have access to NYC’s best fitness instructors right in your living room—there are 100 live classes each week
                            , and its signature 28-minute workouts fit in any schedule. (They also have a 10-minute express workout if you are a little more limited.) To make the most of the program, shoot for five classes a week: two strength-based Define classes, and three cardio-based Sweat classes. 
                            The program gives class recommendations based off your fitness level and experience. It stresses adding resistance when you’re ready, and modifying moves that may be a bit too challenging.
                            like sliders, mini bands, and ankle weights.

                            and guided strength training circuit workouts that get your heart rate up and challenge your muscles. The workouts require some equipment, such as dumbbells, a medicine ball, flat benches, 
                            and a jump rope (although there are substitutions available if there's something you don't have). You can find workouts on the app, but if you’d prefer a traditional book experience, you can also download the guides in e-book form.
                            Cost: $20/month for an app membership; $46 per e-book

                        <p> A 60-day cardio-based program for advanced exercisers.
                            You don't have to be in "extreme" shape to try this program according to Beachbody (the distributor of the workout), but fair warning: Insanity is a challenging program. Created by Shaun T., it includes 10 conditioning workouts that are about 30 to 60 minutes each, and you do them six days per week.
                            Each workout includes cardio and plyometric drills with intervals of strength, power, resistance, and core training, and the method is built around long periods of maximum-intensity effort with short rest periods built in. There's no equipment required, and it also comes with a nutrition guide.
